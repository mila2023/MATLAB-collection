# Numerical ODE Solvers
Final report on tasks â€” a concise summary of the project objectives, methods applied, and key conclusions.

## Overview
This project explores different methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs).  
It begins with the **D-SOLVE** and **ODE45** procedures, followed by three custom numerical methods defined in the assignment.  

## Goals
- Compare the accuracy of the numerical solutions obtained by the three custom methods.  
- Investigate how the calculation step size and variable range affect stability.  
- Demonstrate numerical instability when the step size `h` is too large.  

## Notes
This is an educational project focused on numerical analysis and algorithm behavior rather than production code.
